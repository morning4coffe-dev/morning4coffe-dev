### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
my name is Morning4coffe, but you can call me Coffe. I am a high school student, I am still pretty new to programming. In school, I am currently learning to program in JavaScript (+ HTML, CSS) and I am trying to learn C# on my own. And that is why my code is not perfect, because I am learning as I work on my projects, for example, Storylines.
